1b.  How many stories does that really represent?
5 storiesPseudocode

2.  Add any necessary stories to your existing Pivotal Tracker project. Put these new ones at the top of the list (since the old ones will not be necessary here and can be dragged into the "Icebox" section).

3.  Make sure you think about the Acceptance Criteria for these stories -- the edge cases they cover will govern how much logic you'll have to implement later!

4.  Prioritize the stories based on achieving the easiest minimum functionality as soon as possible and then layering other stories on top of that. Hint: Next/Previous links might be a good start.

5.  For each story, estimate how much work should be required and set its points.
